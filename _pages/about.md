I am a research associate (Postdoc) at Imperial College London. Here I look at how companies, governments and people may be impacted by the changes to energy systems over the coming decades. To achieve this, I lead development on open-source MUSE model.

I joined Imperial in 2020 from Newcastle University following my PhD in computer science. During this time I developed methods based on machine learning, reinforcement learning and multi-agent systems to create long-term energy models of national energy systems. Previously, I studied an MEng in electrical and electronic engineering at University College London. 

### Research

I am interested in the use of computer software and simulations to model complex systems. Through the modelling of these complex systems, one is able to better understand and optimise them without the negative consequences that could occur in the real-world. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of macro-economic policy, computer science and technology and my current work primarily focuses on modelling energy systems. I have a particular interest in working on complex systems and how these make an impact in a global context.

Much of my own work involves the modelling of electricity markets, both over the short and long-term using agent-based models, optimisation and machine learning [[1]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3396851.3397682), [[2]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3396851.3402369).
