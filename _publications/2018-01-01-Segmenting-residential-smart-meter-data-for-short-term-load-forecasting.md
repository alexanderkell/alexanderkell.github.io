In order to reliably generate electricity to meet the demands of the customer base, it is essential to match supply with demand. Short-term load forecasting is utilised in both real-time scheduling of electricity, and load-frequency control. This paper aims to im- prove the accuracy of load-forecasting by using machine learning techniques to predict 30 minutes ahead using smart meter data. We utilised the k-means clustering algorithm to cluster similar individ- ual consumers and fit distinct models per cluster. Public holidays were taken into consideration for changing customer behaviour, as was periodicity of the day, week and year. We evaluated a number ofapproaches for predicting future energy demands including; Ran- dom Forests, Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks and Support Vector Regression models. We found that Random Forests performed best at each clustering level, and that clustering similar consumers and aggregating their predictions out- performed a single model in each case. These findings suggest that clustering smart meter data prior to forecasting is an important step in improving accuracy when using machine learning techniques.
