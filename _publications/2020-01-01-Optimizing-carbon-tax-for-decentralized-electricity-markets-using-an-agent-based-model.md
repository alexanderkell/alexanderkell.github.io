Abstract:

Averting the e?ects of anthropogenic climate change requires a transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon technology. A way to achieve this is to decarbonize the electricity grid. However, further e?orts must be made in other ?elds such as transport and heating for full decarbonization. This would reduce carbon emissions due to electricity generation, and also help to decarbonize other sources such as automotive and heating by enabling a low-carbon alterna- tive. Carbon taxes have been shown to be an e?cient way to aid in this transition. In this paper, we demonstrate how to to ?nd optimal carbon tax
policies through a genetic algorithm approach, using the electricity market agent-based model ElecSim. To achieve this, we use the NSGA-II genetic algorithm to minimize average electricity price and relative carbon intensity of the electricity mix. We demonstrate that it is possible to ?nd a range of carbon taxes to suit di?ering objectives. Our results show that we are able to minimize electricity cost
to below £10/MWh as well as carbon intensity to zero in every case. In terms of the optimal carbon tax strategy, we found that an increasing strategy between 2020 and 2035 was preferable. Each of the Pareto-front optimal tax strategies are at least above £81/tCO2 for every year. The mean carbon tax strategy was £240/tCO2.
